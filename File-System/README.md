# File-System Node.js Internals Project

## Overview

This project is a simple demonstration of Node.js internals, focusing on how Node.js interacts with the file system. It is designed as a learning tool for understanding core Node.js modules and their usage in real-world scenarios.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `fileOperations.js`: Contains functions for performing file system operations using Node.js built-in modules.
- `app.test.js`: Test file for verifying the functionality of the project.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to help you study and experiment with Node.js internals, especially the file system module (`fs`). By working through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

- Reading from and writing to files
- Understanding asynchronous and synchronous file operations
- Using Node.js core modules
- Structuring a simple Node.js project

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the project files.
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies (if required).
3. Use `node app.js` to run the main application.
4. Run tests with `npm test` or `node app.test.js`.

## Learning Outcomes

- Deepen your understanding of Node.js core modules
- Practice implementing file system operations
- Learn how to structure and test Node.js applications
