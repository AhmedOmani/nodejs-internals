# Streams Directory

This directory contains projects and examples related to Node.js Streams, focusing on understanding and implementing custom stream modules as part of Node.js internals study.


## Structure

- `custom-writable-stream/`
  - `writable-stream.js`: Implementation of a custom writable stream in Node.js.
  - `writable-stream.txt`: Output or sample data for the writable stream.
- `custom-readable-stream/`
  - `readable-stream.js`: Implementation of a custom readable stream in Node.js.
  - `src.txt`: Source data for the readable stream.

## Purpose


The goal of this directory is to:
- Explore how Node.js Streams work internally.
- Implement custom writable and readable streams.
- Gain hands-on experience with the stream module and its extensibility.

## Implemented Streams

- **Custom Writable Stream:** Demonstrates how to create and use a writable stream.
- **Custom Readable Stream:** Demonstrates how to create and use a readable stream.

More stream types and examples may be added as you continue learning.
