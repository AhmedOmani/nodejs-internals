# Node.js Internals Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple projects and examples designed to help you study and understand Node.js internals. Each directory focuses on a specific Node.js core module or concept, providing hands-on experience and practical implementations.

## Projects Overview

### File-System
A demonstration of Node.js file system operations, including reading, writing, and managing files using the built-in `fs` module.
- See `File-System/README.md` for details.

### Streams
Explore Node.js Streams by implementing custom writable (and soon readable) streams. This section helps you understand how streams work internally and how to extend them.
- See `Streams/README.md` for details.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to explore.
3. Follow the instructions in each project's README to run and test the code.

## Purpose

- Deepen your understanding of Node.js core modules and internals.
- Practice implementing and extending Node.js features.
- Build a foundation for more advanced Node.js development.
